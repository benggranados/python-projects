# Taker Strategy Simulation â€“ Python

This project models and analyzes a **taker-side trading strategy**, potentially simulating execution on a limit order book. The goal is to understand how aggressive order-taking behavior affects execution cost, order fill rate, and potential profitability under varying market conditions.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Plotly  
- Time-based simulation logic  
- Market microstructure concepts

## ðŸ“ˆ What It Covers
- Taker (market order) behavior simulation  
- Slippage and fill rate analysis  
- Spread dynamics and cost measurement  
- Visualization of trade outcomes

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Taker_Strategy.ipynb` â€“ Core notebook for data analysis, strategy design, and results

## ðŸ“Œ Potential Extensions
- Compare vs. maker (limit order) strategies  
- Add real order book data (e.g., Binance, Polygon.io)  
- Introduce latency and spread response curves  
- Use reinforcement learning to adaptively take/make
