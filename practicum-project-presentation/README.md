# Mortgage Underwriting Automation with NLP & AI

This repository contains the final presentation slides for my Master of Financial Engineering practicum project, completed in collaboration with Jia Finance ‚Äî a fintech platform focused on providing mortgage services to international buyers of U.S. residential real estate.

## üîç Project Overview

We developed an AI-driven solution to enhance the mortgage underwriting process through automation, asset-based evaluation, and AI-powered identity verification. The objective was to streamline decision-making, improve scalability, and reduce processing time for foreign investors.

## üí° Key Contributions

- **NLP Analysis of Financial Documents:**  
  Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from 10-Q and 10-K reports for public companies, enabling risk assessment and benchmark comparison.

- **LLM Integration (GPT & BERT):**  
  Used large language models to convert qualitative disclosures into quantitative signals, supporting underwriting decision-making.

- **AI-Enhanced Identity Verification:**  
  Explored integration of machine learning for automating ID verification and document classification to improve throughput and reduce fraud risk.

## üìä Tools & Technologies

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- NLP (SpaCy, HuggingFace Transformers)
- GPT & BERT (via OpenAI & HuggingFace APIs)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## üéì Team & Acknowledgments
