# Overnight Drift Analysis – Python

This project analyzes **overnight returns (close-to-open drift)** in financial markets, examining whether consistent price patterns exist outside regular trading hours.

## 📊 Objective
- Investigate whether stocks exhibit predictable drift patterns overnight
- Calculate average overnight returns across assets and timeframes
- Visualize distributions and trends in overnight performance

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- (Optional: yfinance / Alpha Vantage for data)

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Close-to-open return computation  
- Time-series slicing  
- Return aggregation and distribution plotting  
- Hypothesis testing (if included)

## 📂 Files
- `overnight_drift_homework.ipynb` – Notebook containing all data exploration, calculation, and visualizations

## 🔍 Potential Extensions
- Compare drift by sector or market cap  
- Add volatility filtering or volume thresholds  
- Backtest a drift-following intraday strategy
